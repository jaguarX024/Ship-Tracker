# Ship-Tracker

This project offers a C++ implementation of a system to manage a fleet of "Ship" objects using various self-balancing and basic tree data structures. It's a great way to see **Binary Search Trees**, **AVL Trees**, and **Splay Trees** in action.

## Key Features

* **Diverse Tree Implementations**: Explore how Binary Search Trees (BST), AVL Trees, and Splay Trees handle data.
* **Ship Data Management**: Efficiently **insert**, **remove**, and **find** ships based on their unique IDs.
* **Educational Focus**: Ideal for understanding the complexities and advantages of different tree algorithms.

## How to Get Started

1.  **Compile**:
2.  Use a C++11 compatible compiler. For example, with g++:
    `g++ fleet.cpp driver_fleet.cpp -o program`
3.  **Run**: Execute the compiled program:
    `./program`

## Project Structure

* `fleet.h` / `fleet.cpp`: Contains the core `Fleet` class, defining the tree structures and their operations.
* `tester.cpp`: Includes comprehensive test cases to validate the functionality and balance of each tree type.
